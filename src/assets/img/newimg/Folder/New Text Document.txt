Print Pocket Folder
With pocket presentation folders, you can make a strong impression before even starting your business pitch. Custom printed presentation folders are versatile marketing tools suitable for business proposals, new product launches, welcome packages, trade show materials, customer service agreements, and much more. The pockets can be designed with slits to hold business cards, mini-CDs, or DVDs on one or both sides. While a varnish coating is standard, you can choose Gloss or Matt Lamination, or UV coating to make your folder truly stand out.
