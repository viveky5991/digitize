Frosted Stickers

Frosted stickers or frosted glass films create the look of frosted or opaque glass, offering privacy and security without sacrificing light or visibility.
These frosted glass stickers are easy to clean using standard glass cleaning products. They are durable and resistant to sunlight and UV damage.
Frosted vinyl stickers are commonly used to enhance privacy in boardrooms and obscure views into personal spaces by applying the film to any partition or glass surface. Additionally, they provide an affordable upgrade to your old transparent glass compared to blinds or curtains.
