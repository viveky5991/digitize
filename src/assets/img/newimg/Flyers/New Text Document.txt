Guidelines for Supplying finished files - Ready to Print Artwork:
* Apply a 2mm bleed over the finished size .
* Convert all fonts to paths or curves .
* Convert all colors to CMYK or Grayscale (No RGB, PMS, Pantone, or Spot colors).
* Flatten transparency effects Set overprints correctly for desired result.
* Remove all color profiles Ensure all bitmap images are minimum 300dpi and in CMYK color mode.
* Ensure reversed type (light type on dark background) is a minimum of 7pt.
* Please supply all files separately as we prefer to do our own imposing. PDF's should be individual files and not multi-page documents.
* Ensure borders and type are within safe zone as variations may occur when trimming.
* Remove registration marks, keylines, dyelines, and other non-printing items If crop marks are required, ensure they are positioned outside the bleed area
